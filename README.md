Some profile stuff for tmux + fish mostly for personal use.

Plugins and customizations.

Pull the repo somewhere (preferably some dot folder in your home directory), and run install.sh script.

Make sure you have fish installed prior to running the script, as it uses fish syntax, I cannot guarantee it will work on bash/sh/zsh or others.
